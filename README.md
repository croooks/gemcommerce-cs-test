# gemcommerce-cs-test

I wrote this assignment using HTML, tailwind, and assets downloaded from Google fonts and the Figma file you shared with me here: https://www.figma.com/design/8PbMqbClR0Bmwd3TEiyozE/Product-page---POD--Copy-?node-id=4526-5426&t=585LuFT7YhZpOh7S-0

Each section uses a combination of grid and flex to create the layout, and I added some basic responsiveness to the layouts since I could not find a responsive layout in Figma.

Due to the time constraints and scope of the assignment, I focused on rapid prototyping and not getting the design pixel-perfect. In a similar vein, I chose to do everything inline or within the one HTML file, and even used tailwind from the CDN instead of as a local build step like one normally might.

For simple and quick deployment, I used github and github pages to host the code and website.

Thank you for your consideration.
